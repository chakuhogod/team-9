Welcome to git repo the best hackathon team participating.

We are bank linq. 

BankLinq is an idea about automating bookkeeping. Companies spend day in day out keeping 
their finances up-to-date. Thee finances are managed by people mainly. We at BankLinq have 
the vision of partially aotmating this process. With the upcoming feature of ABN AMRO, 3rd
parties would be able to access someone's bank account once given access. This is the 
perfect opportunity to put our idea into reality.
